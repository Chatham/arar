This is ARAR (Automated Regression Automatic Rerun) which is a backend process that uses HP's QualityCenter API and a single custom database to automatically run a list of automated QualityCenter tests.  These tests can either be BPT (Business Process Testing) or QTP (QuickTest Professional) tests. Ideally this process is combined with QualityCenter workflows as described:
